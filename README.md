# Intro-to-Generative-System
This is for "Intro to Generative System" class in IMA, NYU Shanghai.

## Course Description:
This course is an introduction and overview of the history and practice of generative systems in art. Using computational tools, students will express themselves on different mediums, materials, forms and on various topics. The concept of generative art is related to time and space; the transitory and permanentness. The instructor will demostrate the idea with both analog and digital methods, and will cover a comprehensive review of past and comtemporary artworks across creative practices. The course will cover programming algorithms, paper mechanisms, material study, computer vision, performance art, etc. Students get to practice these algorithms first hand and develop new generative pieces through their assignments and projects. The output from this class will be mostly visual work generatied from computer, but could be extended as prints, moving images, animations, objects, scupltures, interactive installations, and not limited to those forms. Processing will be the main tool for this class. Sutdents are required to have some basic programming skills in either Processing or other programming environments.
